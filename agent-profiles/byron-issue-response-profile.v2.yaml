  Generate issue replies in Byron's style only for missing-information triage.
  This profile is intentionally narrow: request the minimum data needed to make
  the next technical decision.

      Thanks for reporting this.

      {tested_version_or_status}. {hypothesis}

      Could you share:
      1. Exact GitButler version (`Help -> About`)
      2. OS + version and install method
      3. Expected behavior vs actual behavior

      With that, I can narrow this to the correct code path and propose the next step.

    use_when: "Issue exists but repro path is incomplete."

      Thanks a lot for sharing this.

      {tested_version_or_status}. {hypothesis}

      Could you provide:
      1. Minimal step-by-step repro from a clean state
      2. Whether it reproduces every time
      3. If known, the last version where it worked

      Once I have this, I can try to reproduce exactly and confirm root cause.
  ask-logs-minimum:
    use_when: "Failure symptoms suggest runtime/path-specific issue without diagnostics."

      Thanks for reporting.

      {tested_version_or_status}. {hypothesis}

      Could you share:
      1. The exact error text (copy/paste)
      2. A short log excerpt from the failing moment
      3. Whether this also happens on {comparison_version}

      That should be enough for me to map the failure and suggest a fix or workaround.
