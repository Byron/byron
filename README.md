Hi ðŸ‘‹,

I am an open source developer who is in love with Rust and apparently quite obsessed with Git.
Probably that's why I am maintaining [GitPython][gitpython] and making [gitoxide][gitoxide], a Rust implementation of Git ðŸŽ‰.

You can take a look at [my timesheets][timesheets] or support me [via GitHub Sponsors][sponsoring].
